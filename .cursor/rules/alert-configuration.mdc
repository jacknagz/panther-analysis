When writing rules, follow the guidance below for severity and deduplication:

**Severity Levels:**
- **CRITICAL**: Immediate response (data breach, privilege escalation)
- **HIGH**: Urgent investigation (suspicious activity, policy violations)
- **MEDIUM**: Standard investigation (unusual behavior, compliance)
- **LOW/INFO**: Informational or signals only

**Deduplication Windows:**
- **15 min**: High-frequency events (login failures, API calls)
- **60 min**: Standard security events (privilege changes, data access)
- **180 min**: Compliance events
- **720 min**: Low-frequency events (account creation)
- **1440 min**: Rare events (root account usage)
