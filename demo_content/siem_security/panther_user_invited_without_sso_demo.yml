Description: >
  Detects when a user is invited to Panther by another user (not via SSO). This may indicate a potential bypass of SSO onboarding controls and should be reviewed for compliance and security.
Runbook: >
  1. Review the actor who invited the user and confirm if the invitation was expected and authorized.
  2. Ensure the user was not intended to be onboarded via SSO.
  3. If unauthorized, disable the account and investigate for potential policy violations or malicious activity.
