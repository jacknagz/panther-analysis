Runbook: |
  1. Query panther_audit logs to identify which log source was deleted and by whom
  2. Use list_log_sources to verify current log source configurations and identify gaps
  3. Query data lake to assess data loss - check when logs last arrived from the deleted source
  4. Search for any alerts that may have been missed due to log source deletion
  5. Review alert history for patterns of log source tampering by the same actor
